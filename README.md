# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game


The Tic Tac Toe Game is a fun, interactive game built using Java for the backend logic and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend. The game allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game in their web browsers. The backend manages the game logic, while the frontend is responsible for the game's user interface.

- **Java (version 8 or higher)**
- **Eclipse IDE** (or any Java IDE)
- **Git** for version control
- **Bootstrap** (for styling, included in the project)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToeGame.git
cd TicTacToeGame


```


### 2. Set Up the Backend (Java)
Open the TicTacToeGame project in Eclipse (or your favorite Java IDE).
Ensure you have Java 8 or higher installed.
Build and run the Java classes to handle the game logic (TicTacToe.java and GameController.java).



### 3. Open the Frontend
Navigate to the WebContent folder.
Open the index.html file in your browser.



### 4. Install Dependencies (If Required)
For the backend (Java), no external dependencies are required. Just make sure the src/ folder and classes are set up correctly.

For the frontend, no specific dependencies are required, as the HTML, CSS, and JS files are static.

### Usage
### 1. Start the Backend Server (Optional)
If you're planning to extend the backend with additional functionality or want to run a more advanced Java-based setup, you can configure and run the backend. Currently, the game runs entirely on the frontend without the need for a backend server.

### 2. Access the Game
Once you've opened the index.html file in your browser, you can start playing the game immediately.

The game allows two players to play by clicking on the grid cells.
The first player uses 'X', and the second player uses 'O'.
The game will automatically check for a winner and display the result.
Players can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.
